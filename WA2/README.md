## Phase 2

In this phase we started to improve the parallelism with multithreading and multiple cores using OpenMP, following the same approach: identifying bottlenecks, restructuring the algorithm, and using OpenMP constructs. Additionally, we doubled the 3D grid size of internal cells to 82, increasing the problem size by eight times.
